## About me:

I have always been interested in technologies, but decided to study human languages at the University. I had been working as an English teacher for 7 years until Covid lockdown, when I found out that my teenage hobby can help me make profit and started my career as a 3D-character Artist. This job revived my interest in technologies, but I still felt that it wasn't me dream job.

Everything became clear when my husband, who noticed my curiosity about his projects, gave me *'Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software'* by Charles Petzold. This book revealed my true passion for IT and I started learning algorithms, computer science, languages etc like an addict. 

My first language was C, as I wanted to fully understand how programs allocate memory and practice algorithms writting my own funtcions. Then I had tried some other languages until I decided to deepen my knowledge of learning JavaScript and CSS to become a frontend developer.

I believe, that my passion and ability to gain new skills will help me become a great web developer.
